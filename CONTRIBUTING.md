Do you want to make a pull request?

That's great, but please make any documentation additions or changes only in README.md!

The file doc/perlsubst.txt is generated automatically from README.md. I haven't yet made the script and auxiliary files which do that public, because I first need to rework the documentation for my `runpandoc` wrapper, which is used in the conversion, after a major update, but I will make them public as soon as that is done.

*Please note* that any text in README.md with Markdown `**strong-emphasis**` will become a vimdoc `*tag-target*` and any text with Markdown `*ordinary-emphasis*` will become a vimdoc `|hot-link|`!
